	<p>You escape the shipwreck with barely any scratches on you. The sun is beaming in your eyes. 
	To your right, there is a forest that will help blot out the sun but your brain is telling you to search the beach for any other survivors.
	<br>What do you do?</p>

	<p>Your friend is in the shipwreck. He spots you in the distance and yells
	for your help. As you look around the shipwreck you notice that it is too dangerous

	<p>You see two objects in the sand that must have come from the shipwreck. You spot a knife that may come in

		<br> You can only take one object.  Which one do you choose?</p>

	<p>You want to have a good view of the island to see your surroundings. You spot a tall tree that you believe you are

	<p>As you walk away from the shipwreck, it crumbles before your eyes.  You're thankful you made the right decision to save yourself.  Its starting to get dark and you're growing weak.

<div id="five-a" class="hidden case">
	<p>Your fire is making a lot of smoke- perfect to signal a passing plane or helicopter.  But you start to hear rumblings in the forest.  It seems your fire is attracting something-or someone.  What do you do?</p>
